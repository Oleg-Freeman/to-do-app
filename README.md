## To-Do App
Simple To-Do App project using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and In-Memory storage mode implementation.

In this project i mastered:

    - Storing server items in local memory
    - Svitching between In Memory mode and DB mode
    - Different controllers depending App mode

All components are in the `client/src` folder. All another files was generated by `react-create-app`. 

This project requires next enviroment variables:

    - PORT - Node server port number
    - ATLAS_URI - MongoDB access
    - JWT_SECRET - secret key for token generation
    - STORE_LOCALLY - use to svitch between In Memory mode and DB mode

You can run application in development mode by using script `npm run dev`. To build and run in production mode use script `npm run client:install`, then `npm run client:build` and finally `npm run start`.
